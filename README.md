# Sync Time

I have created three apis:

1) For setting users clock time /set-time
2) For viewing current clock time /get-time
3) For sync time of two users /sync-time

Please note that, 
# First set-time api must be used in order to get user details 
# I have used caching in nodejs, so every time any changes will be done in code, all data will be deleted, then one will have to add new data again


#  Run npm run start to start node server

If any queries, pls reach out to me on : hitarthkansara27@gmail.com

# Thank you
